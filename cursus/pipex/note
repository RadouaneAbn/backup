Example of the command to be like:

	$> echo "hello" > in
	$> echo "world" >> in

now we have hello world separated with a new line

The command:
	$> < in cat | wc -l > out
	$> cat out

out now contains the output of wc -l which is 2 for the above example.

Format:
	$> < file_to_read cmd1 | cmd2 > file_to_write
